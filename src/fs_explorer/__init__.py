"""
FsExplorer - AI-powered filesystem exploration agent.

This package provides an intelligent agent that can explore filesystems,
parse documents, and answer questions about their contents using
Google Gemini for decision-making and Docling for document parsing.

Example usage:
    >>> from fs_explorer import FsExplorerAgent, workflow
    >>> agent = FsExplorerAgent()
    >>> # Use with the workflow for full exploration
    >>> result = await workflow.run(start_event=InputEvent(task="Find the purchase price"))
